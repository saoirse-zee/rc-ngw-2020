# Notes on Never Graduate Week 2020

Each year the alums of The Recurse Center gather for a week. It's called "Never Graduate Week" because we never graduate -- we're all still part of the community even after our batch is over. This year we're gathering online because of COVID-19.

I'll be keeping notes here, inspired by [Ashley Blewer](https://twitter.com/ablwr/status/1259842898922819584?s=20).

## Monday May 11
- Started doing Rustings, an exercise-based approach to learning Rust. Most of this feels like a direct translation of Javascript, but I ran into a few things that just seem odd. Which is exciting! The point of learning Rust is to escape from my JS-centric mindset. It's happening already!
- Looked at Amethyst, a game framework for Rust. Watched a video on ECS (Entity Component System) -- the design principle behind Amethyst (and many other game engines).
- Signed on to the Rust Discord. Chatted a bit. Folks were very responsive! I'm liking the Rust community. It seems they put a lot of effort into making it welcoming for newbies.
